#Readme

This is a simple todo app that currently uses a YAML file for persisting tasks. Tasks can be added, completed, and removed. Completed tasks can either be removed one by one or all at once.

##Installation

1. Clone the repo
2. `cd` into the repo
3. Run `bundle install` to install all dependencies.


Run `ruby app.rb` to start up Sinatra so you can start adding tasks from your webbrowser!

###Todo
Add additional persistance options (e.g. some type of DB adaptor).
